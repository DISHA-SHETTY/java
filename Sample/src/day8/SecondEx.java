	/*Initially the value of i is 3,when it comes to line 8 i.e..,i++ that value 3 is first assigned 
and then incremented,so when it comes to line number 9 the value of i becomes 4
In the line 10 first the value is incremented so in line number 11,the value of i becomes 5
In line 12 the value of i is first incremented and then assigned so it prints 6
In the line 13 the value of i which is 6 is first assigned so it prints 6 again 
and then it is incremented.*/
